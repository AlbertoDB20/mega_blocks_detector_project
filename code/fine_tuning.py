    Script for fine-tuning in python using ultralytics YOLO v8 pre-trained model
    We choose YOLOv8n because is the lightest one, but it is also possible to chose another version of YOLOv8

    TO DO BEFORE COMPILING:
    pip install ultralytics
    pip install torch

    FROM REFERENCE we have:

        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a YOLOv8 model from a pre-trained weights file
        model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')

        # Run MODE mode using the custom arguments ARGS (guess TASK)
        model.MODE(ARGS)


    Where:

    TASK (optional) is one of (detect, segment, classify, pose)
    MODE (required) is one of (train, val, predict, export, track)
    ARGS (optional) are arg=value pairs like imgsz=640 that override defaults.
    Default ARG values are defined on this page from the cfg/defaults.yaml file.

    I also check if MPS is available to be sure to use Apple Neural Engine for M1 processor.
        [ Apple's Neural Engine (ANE) is the marketing name for a group of specialized 
        cores functioning as a neural processing unit (NPU) dedicated to the acceleration 
        of artificial intelligence operations and machine learning tasks. ]
        source: Apple

    AFTER:
    custom_model.py to use the trained model in real environment
