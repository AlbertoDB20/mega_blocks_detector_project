# MEGA BLOCKS DETECTOR PROJECT 

This is a sub module of [ur5_lego](https://github.com/AlphaNightLight/ur5_lego) project that detect and classify mega-blocks with YOLO v8 fine-tuned model. 
From a given dataset, it elaborates and adapt it to YOLO standards. Then uses pre-trained model to fine-tune the network.
